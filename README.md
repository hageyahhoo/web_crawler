This repository is for **"Web Crawler"** based on **[Intro to Computer Science from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101)**.


# Prerequite
We use **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)** as Unit Testing tool for this repository.


# How to Run Unit Tests
1. Create `__init__.py` on each directory beforehand.
2. Move to the project root directory.
3. Run `python -m unittest discover -v` and we can get test results.
